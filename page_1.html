        <h1>Some Dishonored fan plot I found owo</h1>
        <p>FADE IN:

            EXT. DUNWALL TOWER - DUNWALL

            After an EXTENDED JOURNEY, ROYAL PROTECTOR CORVO ATTANO is being transported by RIVERBOAT to DUNWALL TOWER
            to see EMPRESS JESSAMINE KALDWIN.

            CORVO ATTANO

            Whoa whoa, Royal who in the Dunwhat? Run all that by me again.

            RIVERBOAT PILOT

            Hang on, I have a list of all the exposition I need to cram into casual conversation here. Say Corvo, did
            you know that this Victorian-era whalepunk city is currently suffering from a rat-borne plague? And that you
            were away for months trying to find a cure?

            CORVO ATTANO

            I would logically know all that and now I do!

            RIVERBOAT PILOT

            We're not beholden to any specific timeline or universe though, which is why you'll also find magic,
            American accents and all of Nikola Tesla's inventions everywhere.</p>

        <p>He is dropped off and enters DUNWALL TOWER, where he runs into EMILY KALDWIN, the DAUGHTER of the EMPRESS.

            CORVO ATTANO

            A child! In a videogame! That always ends well.

            EMILY KALDWIN

            Corvo, my perhaps father! Let's transparently teach you some stealth mechanics by playing a game of
            hide-and-seek.</p>

        <p>CORVO comically crouches behind a TREE.

            EMILY KALDWIN

            I utterly can't find you!

            CORVO ATTANO

            This is how stealth works? Okay, this is going to be easy.</p>
