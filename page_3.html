        <h1>I dunno what to tell you anymore :P</h1>
        <p>Surely there are some other contracts we can pick up while we're here.
            In my former life I think I might have lived in this district. It's all so fuzzy now.
            No matter how many high-born throats we slit, someone else will crawl to the top of the pile.
            I remember a fish market that used to be around here. All that's left are the flies.
            Does anyone believe this place will actually be habitable again?</p>

        <p>I miss Dunwall's shadows and alleys. There are things hiding in the mist here.
            These masks prove useful yet again. I prefer not to breathe the air here.
            Fascinating what others do with their gifts. I'd say we're much more practical.
            I wonder what the old Brigmore Family would say if they knew witches and assassins would one day prowl in their gardens and cellars.
            We should take our share of the spoils before the Dead Eels get a look at this place.
            Doesn't it seem suspect that the Outsider pits us against others who bear his mark?
            Let’s make these witches regret following Delilah to this moldy ruin.
            We should burn this place to the ground when we’re finished.</p>
